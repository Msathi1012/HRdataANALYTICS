This is a Power Bi end to end project.

I have entailed all the steps below:
I have created a pivot table to see the values that can be used in creating dashboard.
I have imported a csv file in Power BI.
Also, I have removed null value rows and duplicate values
And corrected the spellings, and sorted the data types (if required)

I also created 6 cards :-
1. Total employee count
2. Total attrition
3. Attrition rate
4. Average age
5. Average salary
6. Average year employee work

• Created a Donut chart to show attrition on the base of education level.
• Created stacked column chart to show the attrition on the base of Age.
• Created matrix table which show attrition on the base of job level and show job satisfaction level they gave as feedback.
• Created stacked bar chart which shows attrition on the base of salary groups and another one which shows top 4 attrition by job role.   
• Created stacked area chart on the base of total period employee worked in the company.
• Then I created a slicer by which we can filter data by their departments.
• And at last but not the least Heading.

Thank You for reading up till here!
